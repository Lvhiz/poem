Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
I will compare the to a summer day! 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Please check your temperature. 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
It's July actually. 
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Rain fell yesterday. 
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
You're talking about a black person. 
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
I know right light skin. 
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
